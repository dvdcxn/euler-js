# Euler-js
Project euler solutions and runner created to teach my sister how to code. 

Although each problem may have more laconic or ingenious solutions, those chosen will be using more simplistic and explict code, readibility is preferred to demonstrate logical concepts clearly.

## Build
Ensure node is installed on the path and execute the following commands.
```
npm i
npm build
```
